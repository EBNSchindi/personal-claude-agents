# Personal Claude Agents

This repository contains my personal collection of Claude agent definitions and configurations.

## Overview

These agents are specialized tools designed to assist with various development tasks:

- **architect-cleaner**: Architecture analysis and aggressive repository cleanup agent
- **claude-status**: Dashboard and metrics tracking agent
- **code-reviewer**: Comprehensive code review agent for Python projects
- **doc-writer**: Documentation generation and maintenance agent
- **prompt-engineer**: Transforms vague ideas into precise technical prompts
- **python-generator**: Modern Python 3.10+ code generation with Context7 integration
- **test-engineer**: Comprehensive test suite creation agent

## Structure

Each agent definition is stored as a markdown file containing:
- Agent description and capabilities
- Tool access permissions
- Usage examples
- Specific workflows and best practices

## Usage

These agent definitions are designed to be used with Claude Code and can be invoked through the Task tool with the appropriate `subagent_type` parameter.

## Contributing
