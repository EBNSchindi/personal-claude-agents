[DEINE ANFORDERUNG HIER]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for this session:
1. After the prompt-engineer generates the output, you (Claude) must STOP completely. Do NOT execute any code or invoke any agents.
2. The prompt-engineer should think carefully about the optimal agent chain and include a detailed recommendation with reasoning for each agent in the sequence.
3. The output should be clearly marked as "NOT EXECUTED - DRAFT ONLY"
4. I will manually review the generated prompt before deciding if/when to execute it.
5. Copy the prompt to a directory "./prompts/..." an name it fitting

Please ensure the prompt-engineer:
- Analyzes PROJECT_SCOPE.md for context, otherwise read and understand codebase
- Analyzes AGENT_LOG.md to understand the agent history
- Provides specific agent recommendations with clear reasoning
- Includes alternative agent chains if applicable
- Estimates complexity and duration
- Formats the output for easy copying
```
